## What’s Sim-Devices

Everything began in early 2018, when an encounter with the special keyboards took place at a Comicon. You may check this article if you have a basic proficiency of Chinese.

Anyway, SimPad came into being unexpectedly and wished to grow into Sim-Devices.

## The vision of Sim-Devices

### Goal

Sim-Devices wishes to design a keyboard popular among PC music game players, which can be sold at an affordable prices. Inspired by the word “simple”, the term “Sim” expresses our wish to design simple but useful devices. Sim-Devices values the core-most demand on the devices, which is why we’ve designed it in a way that lowers the cost without undermining the availability and quality of the devices. But I would never cut the expenses on meeting the core needs. Instead, I would invest heavily to select customized parts so as to ensure uncompromised user experience.

### Profits

Both the software and hardware of all products under Sim-Devices is manufactured by a third party, designed and assembled by me. The favorable after-sales policy and stringent quality test leaves me with not much profit. Thanks to the favorable tax policies in China, I managed to sell the products at competitive prices. Mass production would significantly lower the costs but it requires large client size. But I did try out mass production for only a select devices models so as to lower the costs instead of the user experience. ***But mass production expose me to huge risks***, which would not be avoided unless the devices are extremely popular.

***Therefore, I need your help. I would justify your choice with reliable devices and premium services.***

"Made in China" is no longer the synonym of poor quality. I am working to constantly optimize the devices and hope that osu! players everywhere around the globe can witness the charm of "Made In China" products.
