Hi, I'm Handle, the designer of SimPad.

In the last days, I received some reports of SimPad Nano stop working. It is manifested as lights stop working and no response when press keys, but the device could be found in Control Panel.

I have recurrenced this issue and this problem will be fixed after I start school in September. As a temporary solution, you could follow these steps to fix your device.

1. Run control panel and connect to your SimPad Nano
2. Go Advance Settings
3. Go send key packs, input "1C 07 35 56 08 6C 00 00" and then send

It should be useful, if not, please replay this article or send me email mail(at)bysb.net.

Very sorry for the inconvenience.
